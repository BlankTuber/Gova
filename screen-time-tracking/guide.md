# Building a Screen Time Tracker in Go: Implementation Guide

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of Go syntax
* Go installed and configured (which you already have)
* Keywords to search: "go mod init", "go workspace setup", "VSCode Go extension"

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup

* Create a new Go project using `go mod init`
* Keywords: "Go project structure best practices", "Go modules tutorial"

### 2. Process Monitoring Implementation

* Implement process monitoring to track active windows/applications
* Keywords: "golang process monitoring", "windows api GetForegroundWindow", "x11 active window linux", "CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo macos"
* Platform-specific APIs you'll need:
  * Windows: "user32.dll GetForegroundWindow"
  * Linux: "x11 XGetWindowProperty"
  * macOS: "CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo"

### 3. Active Window Title Extraction

* Get the title/name of the active window
* Keywords: "golang GetWindowText", "x11 window title", "NSWindow title macos"

### 4. Time Tracking Logic

* Implement duration tracking for each application
* Keywords: "golang time.Duration", "golang timer implementation", "golang concurrent timers"

### 5. Data Storage Design

* Create data structures for storing application usage
* Keywords: "golang struct serialization", "golang json marshal", "golang sqlite integration"

### 6. Database Integration

* Set up local storage for tracking data
* Keywords: "golang sqlite tutorial", "golang gorm basics", "golang database/sql"

### 7. Activity Classification

* Categorize applications into groups (e.g., productive, entertainment)
* Keywords: "golang maps", "golang string matching", "golang regex patterns"

### 8. Statistics Generation

* Implement daily/weekly report generation
* Keywords: "golang time aggregation", "golang data grouping", "golang time.Time operations"

### 9. User Interface (Optional)

* Create a simple interface to view statistics
* Keywords: "golang fyne gui", "golang gio ui", "golang web server basic"

### 10. Background Service Setup

* Run the tracker as a background process
* Keywords: "golang daemon process", "golang windows service", "golang launchd macos"

## Additional Considerations

* Consider using "golang context" for proper shutdown handling
* Look into "golang os signals" for graceful termination
* Research "golang error handling best practices"
* Investigate "golang logging libraries" for debugging

Remember to start small and incrementally add features. The path from step 1 to step 10 doesn't need to be linear * you might want to start with basic process monitoring and build up from there.
